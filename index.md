# A Unified Classical Computer Vision Framework for Surface Defect Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **domain-independent classical computer vision pipeline** for detecting surface defects in industrial metal components using interpretable machine learning techniques.

Designed specifically for MSME manufacturing environments, the system ensures:

- Low computational cost
- Real-time processing
- CPU-based deployment
- Explainable ML decisions

---

## 🏭 Industrial Motivation

Manual inspection in small and medium-scale industries leads to:

- Human fatigue over long shifts
- Inconsistent defect detection
- Increased production rejections
- High operational costs

This framework provides an automated, reliable, and scalable inspection solution.

## 📊 Why Classical ML Instead of Deep Learning?

- Small labeled datasets (100–500 samples/class)
- Interpretability requirements in industry
- Lower hardware dependency (no GPU required)
- Reduced overfitting risk
