# A Unified Classical Computer Vision Framework for Surface Defect Detection

## Overview

This project presents a domain-independent classical computer vision pipeline for detecting surface defects in metal industries using interpretable machine learning techniques.

---

## Motivation

Manual inspection in MSMEs leads to:

- Human fatigue
- Inconsistent detection
- Increased rejection rates

This framework aims to provide a real-time, cost-effective, and CPU-friendly inspection system.

## System Pipeline

1. Image Acquisition
2. Preprocessing
3. Defect Segmentation
4. Feature Extraction
5. Machine Learning Classification

---

## Feature Extraction

- Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
- Gabor Filters
- Shape Descriptors
- Statistical Features

---

## Machine Learning Models

- PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)
- LDA
- Nearest Centroid
- Random Forest

---

## Why Classical ML?

- Small datasets
- Interpretability
- CPU-based deployment
- Real-time feasibility
